# Decision-Trees-Random-Forests



A decision tree is a 'support tool' for visualizing decisions and their possible consequences by presenting them in a tree-like graph model (branches stem from 'parent' nodes up until a common root). Thanks to the evolution and convergence of statistical analysis and computational sciences we can model a decision tree to find patterns and predict instances in an actual applicable way. These branch nodes represent a conditional 'true' or 'false' selection of a certain dataset parameter which then creates a corresponding branch to the next conditional node in order to . This means that the nodes of a predictive decision tree

create a decision tree model that can be trained with a certain dataset in order to make cualitative (classification) and cuantitative (regression) predictions

In data science and machine learning, decision trees are a supervised non-parametric learning method used for classification and regression.
